         PROTEIN-PROTEIN INTERACTIONS (PPI)
      What are they ?
          Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) refer to the physical contacts between two or more protein molecules. These interactions can be temporary (transient) or permanent (stable). They are fundamental for almost every biological process like forming protein complexes, signaling inside cells, immune responses, metabolism, and more. Proteins interact using specific binding sites through hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, hydrophobic interactions, and van der Waals forces. PPIs are essential because they govern many biological processes including DNA replication, gene expression, metabolic pathways, immune responses, and programmed cell death (apoptosis). Disruption in these interactions can lead to diseases such as cancer, autoimmune disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions. Thus, understanding PPIs not only helps in understanding how life functions at the molecular level but also in identifying the causes of various diseases.

   Applications of the Protein-Protein Interactions
     ðŸ”¬Drug Discovery:
Targeting PPIs enables the development of novel therapies, especially for diseases with previously undruggable targets such as cancer and viral infections. 
     ðŸ§ªDiagnostics:
Abnormal PPI patterns serve as early biomarkers for detecting diseases before symptoms arise, improving diagnosis and treatment planning.
    ðŸ§¬Synthetic Biology:
Engineered PPI networks are used to design programmable cells and synthetic pathways for use in medicine, agriculture, and bioengineering.
    ðŸ§ Functional Genomics:
PPI data helps predict the function of unknown proteins by analyzing their interaction partners within biological networks.
    ðŸ’ŠStructural Biology:
Studying PPIs reveals the architecture and dynamics of large protein complexes, offering insights into their mechanisms at the atomic level.
    ðŸ§« Systems Biology and Trget Validation:
Mapping PPI networks allows researchers to model complex cellular systems and understand how proteins coordinate cellular processes and PPI analysis helps validate protein targets in drug development by confirming their role in disease-related pathways.
    
   The database is about Alzheimer's Disease, Parkinson's Disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Friedreichâ€™s Ataxia (FA). It consists of about 3034 Protein-Protein Interactions involving the listed diseases. 
  
Here is some Information about the Diseases for which the PPIs are present in the database

Alzheimer's Disease  
Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive memory loss, cognitive decline, and behavioral changes. It is caused by genetic mutations, aging, beta-amyloid plaques, and Tau protein tangles. Symptoms include confusion, difficulty in problem-solving, and mood swings. The disease primarily affects the hippocampus and spreads to other brain regions, involving neurotransmitters like acetylcholine and proteins such as beta-amyloid and Tau. Diagnosis involves cognitive assessments, MRI, PET scans, and cerebrospinal fluid tests. Treatment includes cholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, cognitive therapy, and lifestyle adjustments. Preventive strategies involve physical exercise, a brain-healthy diet, social engagement, and cognitive training, but the disease ultimately leads to progressive cognitive decline, loss of independence, and is eventually fatal.  

Parkinson's Disease  
Parkinson's Disease primarily affects movement due to the degeneration of dopamine-producing neurons. It is associated with genetic predisposition, environmental toxins, and aging. Symptoms include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability, as the disease targets the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. Dopamine and alpha-synuclein are key molecules involved in its pathology. Diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and dopamine transporter scans. Treatment includes medications like levodopa, dopamine agonists, and deep brain stimulation, while lifestyle modifications such as regular exercise and a healthy diet help in management. The disease progressively impairs motor function, leading to difficulties in swallowing and, in advanced stages, dementia.  

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)  
ALS, also known as Lou Gehrigâ€™s Disease, is a neurodegenerative condition affecting motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and eventual paralysis. It is caused by genetic mutations, such as those in SOD1 and C9orf72, and environmental factors. Symptoms include muscle weakness, difficulty speaking and swallowing, and respiratory failure, as motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord deteriorate. Glutamate toxicity and SOD1 protein abnormalities play a role in the disease. Diagnosis is confirmed through electromyography (EMG) and genetic testing. Treatments like riluzole and edaravone, along with respiratory support, help manage symptoms, while physical therapy and assistive devices aid in mobility. ALS leads to progressive paralysis and significantly reduces life expectancy.  

Multiple Sclerosis (MS)  
MS is an autoimmune neurodegenerative disorder where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of neurons, leading to symptoms such as fatigue, vision problems, muscle weakness, and coordination issues. It is associated with genetic factors, viral infections, and immune dysfunction, primarily affecting the brain and spinal cord. Key molecules involved include myelin proteins and inflammatory cytokines. Diagnosis involves MRI, lumbar puncture, and evoked potentials. Treatment consists of immunomodulatory drugs, corticosteroids, and physiotherapy. Lifestyle modifications, including a healthy diet and regular exercise, can help manage the condition. The disease progression varies, with periods of relapse and remission, and it can significantly impact daily life.  

Friedreichâ€™s Ataxia (FA)  
Friedreichâ€™s Ataxia is a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by mutations in the FXN gene, leading to reduced frataxin protein levels. It results in progressive damage to the nervous system, affecting movement and coordination. Symptoms include muscle weakness, ataxia, vision and hearing impairment, and scoliosis, as the disease primarily targets the spinal cord, peripheral nerves, and cerebellum. Diagnosis involves genetic testing, nerve conduction studies, and MRI. There is no cure, but treatments such as physical and speech therapy, along with supportive care, can help manage symptoms. While there is no known prevention, maintaining mobility and heart health may slow progression. FA leads to progressive disability, an increased risk of heart disease, and a shortened lifespan.
